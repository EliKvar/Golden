	<p class="bio">My name is Payton Grover. I love bright shiny things and lots and lots of glitter! I find that the best moments include family, friends, outdoors, and food.

	<h3 class="bio">Daniel Lambert</h3>
	<p class="bio"> 
	GIMM/CS dual major at Boise State University. Hobbies include: Hot Springs, UAV/UAS, robotics, game development, and randomly doing research with NASA on impulse. Once finished with school I intend to found (another) game development company, though it will likely be a mostly solo gig. My first programming language was QBasic. I developped my first terrain engine in the Glide API in C++ back in the day.<br>There is always something new to learn.
