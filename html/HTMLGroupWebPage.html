	<p class="bioText">GIMM/CS dual major at Boise State University. Hobbies include: Hot Springs, UAV/UAS, robotics, game development, and randomly doing research with NASA on impulse. Once finished with school I intend to found (another) game development company, though it will likely be a mostly solo gig. My first programming language was QBasic. I developped my first terrain engine in the Glide API in C++ back in the day. There is always something new to learn.</p>
